# CIPHER
CIPHER is a program for the prediction of coding sequences, or open reading frames (ORFs), in transcripts. It is based on the differences in hexamer nucleotide frequencies in sets of known coding and non-coding sequences for different species (see Algorithm). It was used for the first time in the analysis of putative coding transcripts identified by ribosome profiling (Ruiz-Orera et al., 2014).  The user should upload a set of DNA sequences in FASTA format. Possible uses of the program are the prediction of putative proteins in a set of assembled transcripts or the detection of additional peptides produced from a given mRNA. The analysis is restricted to ORFs starting with an ATG codon (Methyonine) and ending with a STOP codon. Empirical p-value cutoffs have been precalculated for ORFs of different minimum length in various model species.
